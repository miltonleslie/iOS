# Project ImgURPhotos
<br>

<h2>Project description</h2>
This project was built to access the Ingur API with "Client ID" and "Client secret" to show the images received in a "UICollectionView", and after clicking on one of the cells, a screen controlled by the "UINavigationController" opens, showing the larger image and the title of said image. All code assembled in the MVVM architecture (Model View ViewModel) and Clean methodology.
